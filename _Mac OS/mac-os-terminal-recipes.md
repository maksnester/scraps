### Homebrew

https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ

#### Search for package

``` bash
brew search file retriever
```

#### Install package

``` bash
brew install wget
```

#### List of installed packages

``` bash
brew list
```

Only packages you installed, without dependencies:

``` bash
brew leaves
```

Tree of dependencies:

``` bash
brew deps --tree --installed
```

#### Update

``` bash
brew update
brew outdated
brew upgrade
```

#### Uninstall package

``` bash
brew uninstall wget
```

#### Cleanup

To remove old versions of packages.

List what can be cleaned up:

``` bash
brew cleanup -n
```

Cleanup particular package:

``` bash
brew cleanup wget
```

Cleanup everything:

``` bash
brew cleanup
```

### Current date and time in UTC

`date '+%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S UTC%z'`

This will give something like this:

`09.03.2017 12:56:33 UTC+0100`

### Resize pictures preserving aspect ratio

```bash
sips --resampleWidth 800 -s formatOptions high *.jpg
```

which is the same thing as:

``` bash
sips --resampleWidth 800 *.jpg
```

* `--resampleWidth 800` - resizes a picture to 800px width (preserving aspect ratio)
* `-s formatOptions high` - quality settings [`low`|`normal`|`high`|`best`|`100`]
* `*.jpg` - search mask for files that will be processed

### Prevent Mac from sleeping

``` bash
caffeinate -u -t 600
```

* `-u` - emulates "user" usage
* `-t 600` - 600 seconds (10 minutes)

### Get your IP address

#### Local

``` bash
ifconfig | grep "inet" | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | grep -Fv ::1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

or without IPv6 addresses (add space after `inet` and remove `::1` filter):

``` bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

or just:

``` bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

* `en0` - your network interface

#### External

``` bash
curl ipecho.net/plain; echo
```

### Disable Gatekeeper

To allow installing applications from any source.

Check the status:

``` bash
spctl --status
```

* `assessments enabled` - feature is turned on (you cannot install apps from any source)
* `assessments disabled` - feature is turned off (you can install from anywhere)

Turn off the feature:

``` bash
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

Turn on the feature back:

``` bash
sudo spctl --master-enable
```

### Search

#### Discover the biggest files

And the biggest directories too, of course.

##### Using `sort`

``` bash
du -sh ~/* | sort -rn | head -10
```

* `du` - utility that displays the file system block usage
    * `-s` - show only top-level folders (without showing subfolders)
    * `-h` - present folders size in a human-readable format
    * `~/*` - count everything from the home directory
* `sort` - utility for sorting results
    * `-r` - reverse the list (because by default it goes ascending)
    * `-n` - sort by numeric values (size, in our case)
* `head` - shows only specified number of lines from result

However, this `sort` sorts only numbers without respecting the data unit (MB, GB, etc):

``` bash
username@MacBook-Pro:~$ du -sh ~/* | sort -rn | head -10
880M	/Users/username/Applications
879M	/Users/username/temp
 56G	/Users/username/Library
 34M	/Users/username/Desktop
 23G	/Users/username/Pictures
 11G	/Users/username/Music
9.2G	/Users/username/Documents
```

##### Using `gsort`

``` bash
du -sh ~/* | gsort -rh | head -10
```

``` bash
username@some-MacBook-Pro:~$ du -sh ~/* | gsort -rh | head -10
 56G    /Users/username/Library
 23G    /Users/username/Pictures
 11G    /Users/username/Music
9.2G    /Users/username/Documents
6.3G    /Users/username/Movies
2.3G    /Users/username/Downloads
880M    /Users/username/Applications
879M    /Users/username/temp
```

So, it is all the same, but instead of `sort` we are using `gsort`, which supports `h` option (that respects human-readable data units). If you don't have `gsort` in your system, it can be installed via `brew install coreutils`.

#### Search in your folders

Let's find all the files (and folders) in your home folder that are related to the **GarageBand** application:

``` bash
find ~ -iname "*garage*"
```

Two `*` wildcards will help to find any file (and folder) that contains `garage` in any part of its name.

You can also look for all `.mp4` files in your home directory:

``` bash
find ~ -iname "*.mp4"
```

And here's a more complex example: look for all `.mp4` files in your home directory, then sort results by the file size and show only top 10 biggest ones:

``` bash
find ~ -iname "*.mp4" -print0 | xargs -0 du -sh | gsort -rh | head -10
```

* `find` - utility for searching
    * `-iname` - look in file names, ignoring case and using `*` wildcard to specify the `.mp4` extension
    * `-print0` - adds a NULL character (instead of newline) after the name of each found file. This is needed for long file names with spaces and stuff
* `xargs` - takes result strings from the previous command and uses them as arguments for the next command in pipe (for `du` in our case)
    * `-0` - tells xargs to expect NULL characters as separators instead of spaces (that aligns with our `-print0` from `find`)
* `gsort` - read about it [here](#discover-the-biggest-files)

#### Looking for a string in files contents

Search in files of parent directory only (without going into subfolders):

``` bash
grep -ils "sOmE tEXt" *.txt
```

* `grep` - utility for searching text
    * `-i` - ignoring case
    * `-l` - output only file names
    * `-s` - don't show warnings like `Is a directory`
    * `*.txt` - file name pattern, but works only with a single directory level (doesn't apply to subfolders)

Search in subfolders too:

``` bash
grep -ilrn "sOmE tEXt" *
```

* `-r` - search recursively (in subfolders). Now there is no need in option `-s` (I guess)
* `-n` - add line numbers

Search in particular files only:

``` bash
grep -ilr "sOmE tEXt" --include=*.{txt,mark*} *
```

* `--include=` - proper file name pattern that applies to all folder levels. This particular one will process only `.txt` and `.markdown` (all `.mark*` ones, to be precise) files

Another (clearer) way:

``` bash
grep --include=\*.{cpp,h} -irn "/some/path/" -e "sOmE tEXt"
```

### Filter out error messages

Say you want to exclude error messages from some output.

If you want to exclude all the errors:

``` bash
find / -iname "*.mp4" 2>/dev/null
```

If you want to exclude only specific errors:

``` bash
find / -iname "*.mp4" 2>&1 | grep -v "Operation not permitted" | grep -v "Permission denied"
```

### ZIP files

``` bash
zip -r9T archiveName.zip folderToArchive -x "*.DS_Store"
```

* `-r` - recursive, including all subfolders
* `-9` - compression level: from `0` (no compression) to `9` (maximum compression)
* `-T` - test archive integrity after finishing

To unpack the archive into current folder:

``` bash
unzip archiveName.zip
```

### Create a dummy file to occupy space

``` bash
dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/stupidfile.crap bs=20m
```

This will start to create a file, "growing" it with 20 MB chunks of random trash. The process will never stop, so you'll need to break it with `⌃ + C`.

If you want to monitor the file's size in Terminal, install and run `watch` utility:

``` bash
brew install watch
watch ls -alh /tmp/stupidfile.crap
```

### Working with an SD card

#### Create an image of the card

``` bash
diskutil list
sudo dd if=/dev/rYOUR-CARD of=/path/to/image.img bs=1m
```

#### Write the image to the card

``` bash
diskutil list
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/YOUR-CARD
sudo dd if=/path/to/image.img of=/dev/rYOUR-CARD bs=1m
```
* `r` - raw, makes the writing faster

You can watch the progress by pressing `⌃ + T` combination.

After it's finished, eject the drive:

``` bash
diskutil eject /dev/YOUR-USB-DRIVE
```

#### Format the card

Available file systems:

``` bash
diskutil listFilesystems
```

##### FAT32

``` bash
diskutil list
sudo diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 CARD-LABEL MBRFormat /dev/YOUR-CARD
```

##### JHFSX

Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled):

``` bash
sudo diskutil eraseDisk jhfsx MAC /dev/YOUR-CARD
```

### Generate PPK file from RSA

So you have your RSA key to connect to some server via SFTP. But suddenly you need to connect to this server from Windows using FileZilla, and it accepts only PPK files.

``` bash
brew install putty
puttygen ~/.ssh/id_rsa_server -o server.ppk
```

### Convert OXPS to PDF

``` bash
brew install ghostscript
/usr/local/Cellar/ghostscript/9.26/bin/gxps -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=~/Desktop/output.pdf -dNOPAUSE some-file.oxps
```

### Disable System Integrity Protection

1. Reboot the Mac and hold down `Command + R` after you hear the startup chime, this will boot macOS into Recovery Mode;
2. Click the Utilities menu at the top of the screen instead and choose Terminal;
3. `csrutil disable`;
4. Reboot the Mac.

### Change system sounds

1. Disable [System Integrity Protection](#disable-system-integrity-protection);
2. Choose the sound file you want to change (`/System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/dock/drag to trash.aif`);
3. Replace it with a sound of your choice;
4. Enable System Integrity Protection back.

### Unlock files in folder

```
chflags -R nouchg /path/to/some/folder
```

* `-R` - recursive;
* `nouchg` - removes immutable flag.

### Turn the screen off

```
pmset displaysleepnow
```
